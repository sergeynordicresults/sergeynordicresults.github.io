Your Japan back then it's now our Russia

Just like japanese people now saying and teaching in schools that Nanjing didn't happen [1](https://qr.ae/pyhdva) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/6fau39/comment/dkkr1ub/?context=3), Russians say that Bucha didn't happen [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XNlSg9CUlc)

  Just like old german woman were saying "No, this is all fake", when they saw a pile of skulls of dead jew people near the cremation furnaces 
  
  1. Why, when I watch cctv news and You show lavrov saying “This war which was launched against us…”, Why [You dont show the laugh?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGizGLceM-I)
  2. Why you dont show what is happening in Ukraine [1](https://t.me/nevzorovtv/8577), [2 (first days of war. there were soldiers in homes? really?)](https://www.facebook.com/hope4ukraine/videos/this-is-never-seen-before-video-pov-from-russian-tank-in-mariupol-shooting-at-re/727612701949066/)
  2. Why You torture uyghurs and tibetian people? ([tortures](https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-53671502), [special passports based on race](https://youtu.be/s5osMrbfnbc?t=623), [closed](https://www.travelchinacheaper.com/wp-content/uploads/China-Map-Travel-Restrictions.jpg) [territories](https://www.travelchinacheaper.com/which-parts-of-china-require-a-permit-to-travel) to prevent knowledge spreading to kill native people and then recolonize territories?)
  3. Why You want to start a war with Taiwan and America?
  4. Why China gives North Korea money to support this kim-shit dictotorship and GULAGs? Why not stop supporting kim-asshole, so that people of North Korea would finally liberate themselves?
  
  Chinese people say:
  1. "If my country will start a war with Taiwan - ok. **I want to see taiwan people dead**, they are all spies of America, just want to steal our technology"
  1. "Everything will change, when China will take over the world, noone will say ['I want to feed chinese babies to aligators'](https://worldstarhiphop.com/videos/wshhaEUJeT3M8808M0wi/horrible-charleston-white-says-chinese-women-and-babies-deserved-to-be-rped-and-used-as-alligator-bait)" <sub>(I feel Your pain, my friend, Im with You, Im angry with him too, this is just for the fullness of information)</sub>
  1. "Ukranians should just surrender" (yes, while russians torture us. If russians would kill president of Ukraine and would win this war - would You be happy)
  2. "This was is a fault of ukranians, nothing would happen if You didnt want to be closer to Europe"
  1. "We are with ukraine, but You know, this war is a fault of America" <sub>(yes, of course, ["america played with a russian bear"](https://t.me/nevzorovtv/8137)? or maybe its all because of covid - putin and president of usa were not speaking in real life, but through the video calls?)</sub>

# Who were Stalin, Lenin and Mao

.... 

# How to stop wars

<details><summary>What have happened in Ukraine</summary>

  In 2014, russians said "we give high probability, that IF people in Krimea and Donetsk and Lugansk will vote right now for "TO WHICH COUNTRY THEY WANT TO BELONG TO" THEN (we think) they will choose russia. That's why, without doing this voting, but only because we have such hunch, we will go and fucking liberate this people. Liberate them from their property (stealing business from Krimea people), and make the Donetsk and Lugansk a battlefield, to distract ukranians from Krimea. And, when ukranians will attack our army, while we are hiding in the buildings in Donetsk, we will say they attack civilians"

Truth be said, I (srghma) give probabilities:
- in 2014: Krimea - 50 russia/50 Ukraine, Donetsk and Lugansk - 30 russia/70 Ukraine
- after a war, after Bucha, after rapes: Krimea - 5 russia/95 Ukraine, Donetsk and Lugansk - 5 russia/95 Ukraine
</details>



These problems:
1. russia went to "liberate" ukraninans
2. Basque Country wanted to be devided from Spain <sub>([ETA terrorists attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ETA_attacks) killed lot of people, now suppressed for good)</sub>
3. China tortures Uygur and Tibet people, wants to start a war with Taiwan <sub>(not because they are bad people, but because they fear to lose territories and become vulnerable)</sub>

HOW TO SOLVE: create the Blockchain voting app to vote "TO WHICH COUNTRY THEY WANT TO BELONG TO" 

WHAT IS STOPPING US FROM MAKING THIS: first, we should make the "information, about all people open for all countries".

By this I mean: every time the new human beign is being born on this planet - make information `<name, address>` available for every human being. This will allow us to make votings.

HOW THIS WILL WORK:

1. For Ukraine, back in 2014, before russian told "we give hight probability that people will choose us", before occupation

Ukranians would tell: 

> ok, putin-shit, you think we will choose you? ok, we are willing to sacrifice the probability that people of Krimea and Donetsk and Lugansk will choose to live under your dictatorship.
> 
> Lets do the voting:
> 
> 1. Lets use the current borders of oblasts/provinces/regions of Donetsk and Lugansk and Krimea
> 2. we can make 1 vote that will decide everything 
> 
> OR we can repeat the voting process untils results will not gravitate to one side with least 65% of votes (for example)
>
> IF people will choose Russia THEN ok, this is a desire of people, what can we do?
> 
> 1. We hope you will improve these territories. 
> 3. We will try to keep in mind that borders dont really matter from cosmological perspective
> 2. We should be happy, because we just prevented the wars and tortures. 
> 
> We ARE HAPPY, because 
> - ITS BETTER we, all ukranians, will be feeling the mental pain for loosing a territory (because our country, the result of all our work and sacrifices, has not been enough to convince people to stay with us)
> - THAN SOMEONE, even 1 person, will be tortured 
>
> Eliezer Yudkowsky: [better all humans will get the small pain of one dust speck hurting the eye, THAN one human will be tortured for 50 years.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3wYTFWY3LKQCnAptN/torture-vs-dust-specks)
> 
> What would I vote in this exact situation, if russia would win and Donetsk (my home place) would become part of russia - would go on st


4. China

1. Uygurs - give them to vote "Do You want to create your own country?"

> P.S. I think they will vote "yes"

2. Tibet - give them to vote "Do You want to return Tibet a status of separate contry?"

> P.S. I think they will vote "yes"

4. 
I know, you are not bad people, you just fear that you will lose territories. OK, yes, I think Tibet and Uygurs will vote for divide, yes, China will become smaller. But does really matter? Will it matter in a world without borders? In a world where we don't work anymore? In a world where all what have left to us is to help each other, until the recipient is fed up with help, just like in Masyana cartoon https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uoU6kE9oSu4

# What have happened in Tiananmen square

One chinese guy have told me:

> One bad chinese guy (TODO: what is his name?) was inducing young chinese students to make a revolution, so that [Japan, America, Russia and other countries (all countries were there, even Spain and ukranian cossacks)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Peking_(1900)) could enter the China, and cause the destruction, as they once have already done. So, yes, some students have died, but it was needed

My reply (right now):

> Maybe this is true. Depends on "Would other countries attack?"
>
> I, personally, wouldnt kill students. I dont like all this "GULAG / dictator" shit. 
> 
> I would allow other countries to attack. This would be their perdition. I am sure they would lose. These attacker-countires would be remembered in the history as shitty countries.
> 
> Example: 
> 1. russia. Did Ukraine attack russia? No, Ukraine have waited. Its russia attacked us under the pretext of "they would attack us first". This shit is not supported by their own people.
> 2. usa attack on Vietnam
