  1. "We are with ukraine, but You know, this war is a fault of America" <sub>(yes, of course, ["america played with a russian bear"](https://t.me/nevzorovtv/8137)? or maybe its all because of covid - putin and president of usa were not speaking in real life, but only through the video calls?)</sub>

# Who were Stalin, Lenin and Mao

  <sub>Nevzorov: history is like a meat on the counter, and historian is a salesman, and you can buy whatever version of history you like, just like a meat. Because history cannot be proved by experiments. Even if you have records - there is still some probability that they are fake.</sub>

History from "GULAG archipelago" by Solzhenitsin:

1. First, there was a Lenin
  
  He thought 
  
  > "there is no way I can build a new county while village people are alive, because they are all religious, believe in superstitions and prophecies, alcoholics and dont want to work".

 
  > From "Gulag" book: `И хотя В.И.Ленин в конце 1917 года для установления "строго революционного порядка" требовал "беспощадно подавлять попытки анархии со стороны пьяниц, хулиганов, контр-революционеров и других лиц", Ленин, собр.соч.,5 изд., т.35, стр.68.`

  So, he started killing them and making them slaves (forcing to work is not a slavery? how you will get a new Einstein when everyone are working?)
  
2. Then, there was a Stalin 
  
He continued this new tradition of making people a slaves and stealing their money, but also started a hunt for "kulaks/middle class people / people with private property / people with business / people with arable fields" 

From ["Jordan Peterson - Pareto Distributions" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcEWRykSgwE) <sub>(80% of books are written by 20% of authors, 80% of money have 20% of people)</sub>:
- But "kulaks" **IS** these 20% of people that create 80% of resources ⚠️ ⚠️ They know how to make bread ⚠️ ⚠️
- By killing and enslaving "kulaks" he started the great hunger
- Then he said "on god, hunger comes to Moskow, my own people will make a revolution and kill me. Ah, there are ukranians, these people are always a problem, always want the independence. I will lie to them, take their wheat harvest, and they will die"
  
This time is called [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor). People were dying by villages, mothers were eating their babies, corpses of people have been sold on the meat counters.

Till this day, the bread is sacred for ukrainians. My grandmother Lyba was always telling me "don't leave bread crumbs, eat them, the bread is sacred"
  
  P.S.
  1. Also, stalin was stealing a gold from people. Police was torturing people until they tell where they hide the gold, pulling their gold teeths out of the mouth
  2. Maybe, [stalin raped 13 years old](https://twitter.com/HLKodo/status/1457366109238153218?lang=en)

Didn't Mao Zedong do the same with China? 
  
Though he had this example:
  - Stalin tries to "remove kulaks" 
  - AND HE SEES that this have caused a famine in USSR in 1932 (because Stalin have fucking killed people that knew how to make bread)
  - BUT he anyway decides to do this same "kulaks killing"
  
Result is [Great Chinese Famine in 1959](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine)

(not even mentioning other killings)

  Come on, guys:
  1. on one hand - yes, doing trans-operations on people before 21 years (for example) is a crippling.
  2. But after 21 year - who cares? You cannot sleep, knowing that two grown up man fuck each other in the ass? You can! You can live with this knowledge! But these two gay people CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THEIR LOVE! They cannot import their creativity into society! They dont feel freedom. For You to allow this - is nothing, for these two guys - everything
  3. Even if being non-binary is a mental ilness - its not like the pedofilia (mental illness, people that have it should want to be reprogrammed, I think)
  
  Gay people should have a right to marry (with all legal stuff), because "How they will grow up as people, without being able to impose additional constraints on each other? Constraints are also a ground for growing new liberties" (just like in functional programming - function that accepts everything, identify function, should not do anything with its argument)
  
  Gay people should have a right to adopt children. What do You fear? That they will spoil children? IF I was a gay and I had money THEN I dont think I would spoil an adopted child.

  Arestovich: all problems are because of "disciplinary societies":
  
  - "believing that people require control outside, because there are more evil inside of people, than good"

  VERSUS
  
  - "believing people have more good inside, than evil" 
  
  > For example:
  > - Countries where you can cross the double line, when there are no other cars, and police will not tell you anything

  I fear, if/when China economy will start to go down

  > 2. then "cheap labor force" becomes "expensive" (China becomes world-leader-2) 
  > 3. now country (China) have to export it's buisness to other country too (e.g. some Africa country), this new country becomes "world-leader-3"
  
  I fear when this will happen, Xi, to preserve his position, will play the same card as putin:

# How to stop wars

<details><summary>What have happened in Ukraine</summary>

In 2014, russians said:
- we give high probability, that IF people in Krimea and Donetsk and Lugansk will vote right now for "TO WHICH COUNTRY THEY WANT TO BELONG TO" THEN (we think) they will choose russia.
- That's why, without doing this voting, but only because we have such hunch, we will go and fucking liberate ukranians. 
- Liberate them from their property (stealing business from Krimea people)
- Make the Donetsk and Lugansk a battlefield, to distract ukranians from Krimea. And then, when ukranians will attack our army, while we are hiding in the buildings in Donetsk, we will say that they attack their own civilians (which is true, bad people exist in all armies AND perfect weapon doesnt exist, but who have started all this?)

Truth be said, I (srghma) give probabilities:
- in 2014: Krimea - 50 russia/50 Ukraine, Donetsk and Lugansk - 30 russia/70 Ukraine
- after a war, after Bucha, after rapes: Krimea - 5 russia/95 Ukraine, Donetsk and Lugansk - 5 russia/95 Ukraine
</details>



#### These problems:

1. russia went to "liberate" ukraninans
2. Basque Country wanted to be devided from Spain <sub>([ETA terrorists attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ETA_attacks) killed lot of people, now suppressed for good)</sub>
3. China tortures Uygur and Tibet people, wants to start a war with Taiwan <sub>(not because they are bad people, but because they fear to lose territories and become vulnerable)</sub>

can be solved

#### HOW TO SOLVE
create the Blockchain voting app to vote "TO WHICH COUNTRY THEY WANT TO BELONG TO" 

#### WHAT IS STOPPING US FROM MAKING THIS

1. to make votes in China, right now

> nothing

2. to make votes in Ukraine, back in 2014

> Question is: How to make the voting process **SO TRUSTWORTHY**, so that even such shitty people, like putin (people that dont want to accept results), had no other choise, except of **ACCEPT IT**
> 
> (I think) what stops us is: 
> 1. we should make the "information, about all people of all countries" **PUBLIC/OPEN-SOURCE/INTERPLANETARY**
> 
>   By this I mean: every time the new human beign is being born on this planet - make information pair `<name, address>` published on blockchain and available for every human being.
>   
> 2. accept this voting process by big countries as a way to resolve problems


#### HOW THIS WILL WORK

1. For Ukraine, back in 2014, before russian told "we give hight probability that people will choose us", before occupation

> Ukranians would tell: 
> 
> ok, putin-shit, you think we will choose you? ok, we are willing to sacrifice the probability that people of Krimea and Donetsk and Lugansk will choose to live under your dictatorship.
> 
> Lets do the voting:
> 
> 1. Lets use the current borders of oblasts/provinces/regions of Donetsk and Lugansk and Krimea
> 2. we can make 1 vote that will decide everything 
> OR we can repeat the voting process untils results will not gravitate to one side with at least 65% of votes (for example)
>
> **IF** people will choose Russia **THEN** ok, this is a desire of people, what can we do?
> 
> 1. We hope you will improve these territories. 
> 3. We will try to keep in mind that borders dont really matter from cosmological perspective
> 2. We should be happy, because we just prevented the wars and tortures. (do You want solve these problems with wars OR voting?)
> 
> We should be happy, because 
> - ITS BETTER we (all ukranians) will be feeling the mental pain for loosing a territory (because our country, the result of all our work and sacrifices, has not been enough to convince people to stay with us)
> - THAN someone, even 1 person, will be tortured 
>
> Eliezer Yudkowsky: [better all humans will get the small pain of one dust speck hurting the eye, THAN one human will be tortured for 50 years.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3wYTFWY3LKQCnAptN/torture-vs-dust-specks)
> 
> ---------------------
> 
> What would I vote for? I didnt like ukranian language that time (language of village people? stupid me, beautiful language, not a language of rapists), but I would vote pro-ukraine
> 
> What would I do **IF** russia would win AND Donetsk (my home place) would become part of russia? I would:
>   1. say "wow, now everything is being decided by old people, who want to return to the Soviet Union times?". 
>   2. I would go on streets, I am fine living in Ukraine.
>   3. BUT IF this doesnt change anything AND economic situation is fine THEN I would stop.
>   
> P.S. 
>   
>   1. This doesnt mean that I want the ukranian culture to die-out.
>   2. [I do wish bad cultures to die out](https://github.com/srghma/srghma.github.io/blob/main/psilocybin.md#preservation-of-cultures-or-languages), e.g. aztec cultures with religious sacrifices, but Ukranian culture is not bad. 
>   3. I dont think this WOULD cause the ukranian culture to die-out. 


2. China

  - Uygurs
   
>  - give them to vote "Do You want to create your own country?"
>
>   Maybe they will vote "yes", maybe "no". 
>   - Does it matter?
>   - Arent reasons above convincing? (borders dont make sense from cosmological perspective, preventing tortures) 
>   - I think it would be even better for chinese culture to leave only people that are united with some goal. 
>   - Of course if these goals are:
>     - lets be building the open-source technologies, lets share all our technologies with everyone, because they share everything with us
>     - lets make all humans be greatful to us, because we were first to unite, we were first to create **DEVISE THAT MAKES FOOD FROM AIR**
>     - yes, we are united by race and history, but we are not racists, we accept everyone
>     - in the end we want to liberate people from the work. Leave nothing to do, except of study this universe and help each other <sub>(just like in [Masyana cartoon](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uoU6kE9oSu4), until recipient will say "oh, god, I am so bored with you, you are helping me too much")</sub>
>   - The goal should not be "lets force everyone to be under our rule" OR "lets rush with technologies and make AI self-conscious"

  - Tibet 
  
> - give them to vote "Do You want to return Tibet a status of separate contry?"
>   I think they will vote "yes". Because, based on ["Seven Years in Tibet" film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years_in_Tibet_(1997_film)), Tibet is not a China.

  - Taiwan

> - give them to vote "Do You want to join China (also change the political structure from democracy to communism)"
>   I asked a Taiwan guy: what probabilities you give for people in Taiwan to join China?
>   He replied: 30% want Taiwan to stay as it is, 20% want it to join China, 50% have not decided. But many actors and singers (people whose profession is not thinking) are pro-chinese, because of money and commerce
> 
>   **IF** I (srghma) would live in Taiwan **THEN** I would not join **BECAUSE** I like the internet to be free.


# What have happened in Tiananmen square

One chinese guy have told me:

> One bad chinese guy (TODO: what is his name?) was persuading young chinese students to make a revolution, so that [Japan, America, Russia and other countries (all countries were there, even Spain and ukranian cossacks)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Peking_(1900)) could enter the China, and cause the destruction, as they once have already done. So, yes, some students have died, but it was needed

My reply (right now):

> Maybe this is true. Depends on "Would other countries attack?"
>
> I, personally, wouldnt kill students. I dont like all these post-USSR dictatorships, GULAGs, lot of laws <sub>(by the way, Arestovich said "I want to leave only the most basic laws")</sub>, army as religion. 
> 
> I would allow other countries to attack. This would be their perdition. I am sure they would lose. These attacker-countires would be remembered in the history as shitty countries.
> 
> Example: 
> 1. russia. Did Ukraine attack russia? No, Ukraine have waited. Its russia attacked us under the pretext of "they would attack us first". This shit is not supported by their own people.
> 2. USA attack on Vietnam. I dont like USA because of this.
