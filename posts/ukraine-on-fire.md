This is what one of russians have sent me when I asked "why do you attack us"?

He have sent it to me and said "maybe in future we will see the whole truth" (LOL, he still doesn't think that putin-pidaras created a war just to distract people of rUSSIA from problems inside of a country)

----

What it is about:
1. It contains interviews with putin (pidaras) and yanukovich (old ukr president, pidaras too)
2. The revolution in ukraine in 2014 was created by american government
3. american government heated both sides of revolution: on one side was giving money to ukranian nationalists (right sector, anti-moskow) AND on other side (through some ukranian politics) gave order to police to beat ordinary people

But they don't tell about: 
1. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-protest_laws_in_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-protest_laws_in_Ukraine) laws of 16th january of 2014, yanukovich wanted to create a new dictatorship in Ukraine
2. Yes, I agree that America had reasons to remove yANUKOVICH (agent of moskow) from position of president, but pUTIN TOO had reasons to create a revolution - to seize the Krimea while everyone are distracted (because this is what psychopats do, they put quarrel between people)


So, I wouldn't be shocking for me, if in future we will find out that it was pUTIN who gave weapons and money to ukranian (anti-moskow) right sector (even thought they are enermies), to be able to tell later `you see, russian people, they are all nazis, that's why we should "liberate" Ukraine`


P.S. Poroshenko is an agent of moskow too, check [Bigus info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZJG_RKktBQ) , he was sending ukranian money to russian soldiers in DNR
