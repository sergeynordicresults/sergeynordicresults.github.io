# marijuana

⚠️ **Dont try it until 25!!! (until Your brain connections are crystalized)** ⚠️

In Ukraine, bc marijuana is not legalized, it is actually sold out with chemicals (<sup>by some people that should be in jail for this, like poroshenko, bc "fish rots from the head"</sup>), that cause damage to the brain. And then, stupid children (like me and my friends) buy it. And then think *"WOW, why I am less smart as I was?"*

*LEARN ON MY MISTAKES!!!*

--------

Now You think: "what will happen if I will try?"
Answer: nothing interesting. You will sink into the kind of ["Shephard tone"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone) (this is the sound-illusion, it makes you think that pitch is always increasing)

But the "Shephard tone" for the thoughts. It will make You think:
1. "Wow, this thought I had right now is the most interesting thought/notice I had in my life¨
2. "Oh, no, the tought I just had is NOT the most interesting. NOW is the most interesting thought in my life!!!¨
3. ¨No, no, no.... these two is not the most interesting. NOT is the most interesting¨
4. ....... and so on until infinity

Summary: dont try it, nothing interesting, just makes **"You can be mesmerized by our universe infinitively"** feature of our universe more visible by making you more stupid
