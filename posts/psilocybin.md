# marijuana

⚠️ **Dont try it until 25 !!! (until Your brain connections are crystalized)!! With or without additives, marijuana impairs Your brain** ⚠️

In Ukraine, bc marijuana is not legalized, it is actually sold out with chemicals (<sup>by some people that should be in jail for this. like poroshenko, bc "fish rots from the head", this guy clearly wasnt trying to improve society</sup>), that cause damage to the brain. And then, stupid children (like me and my friends) buy it. And then think *"WOW, why I am less smart as I was?"*

*LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES!!!*

--------

Now You think: "what will happen if I will try?"

Answer: nothing interesting

You will sink into the kind of ["Shephard tone"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone) illusion (this is the sound-illusion, it makes you think that pitch is always increasing)

But this "Shephard tone" is for the thoughts. It will make You think:

1. "Wow, this thought I had right now is the most interesting thought/notice I had in my life¨
2. "Oh, no, the tought I just had is NOT the most interesting. NOW is the most interesting thought in my life!!!¨
3. ¨No, no, no.... these two is not the most interesting. NOW is the most interesting¨
4. ....... and so on until infinity

Summary: dont try it, nothing interesting, just makes **"You can be mesmerized by our universe infinitively"** feature of our universe more visible by making you more stupid

## But

one interesting thought i indeed had:

1. it's it possible to suffer indefinitely in our universe? (now, we know that the universe will end, so ♾️ not possible?).
1. to create a brain, put it to the machine of suffering, send it to the space with near light velocity, so that no good human could catch it and disable suffering
1. what is the maximum of the suffering? `Suffering Force` = `Suffering Time` <sub>(till the end of universe?)</sub> * `Suffering Power` <sub>(neutral networks become accustomed to pain OR it's possible to make it novel all the time?)</sub>

⚠️ **It will not make you better/more compassioned person (without reading Eliezer Yudkowsky), as it didnt make Charles Manson a better person** ⚠️

### Prelude: 

Once, my friend have shown me one very bad video, that I couldn't watch it even for a second. I will not tell the content of this video, but it involves an infant and a man.

My first thought was: This should not be forgotten!

And then, in the subconsiousness, unknown to me:
1. Am I capable for these actions?
2. How badly I should be treated by this universe and inhabitants to desire to do this?
3. 
  - **IF** some person has such desires **THEN** what should he do?
  - Should he go to the doctor?
  - Should he rewire his brain to stop wanting this (maybe it's like an alcohol addiction?) ? (this desire clearly warps the fabric of reality)
  - Should humans follow their natural wiring at all? <sub>(the whole plot of Doctor House, who the whole series cannot decide what is better: to be the psychopath and have everything OR follow natural wiring and be good. Suffering in both cases)</sub>

### Story:

So, one day I tried mushrooms, then was walking in the woods, then laid and slept and had a dream:

I was in a Kavin Spacy body, but I was hating this universe. I went to the kindergarten and started pouring hot water on the hands of kindergarten teachers until the flash started to peel off from the hands (inspired by ¨Men Behind the Sun¨ film, which I didnt watch).

So, I was torturing the grown up people, but I couldnt torture children. Instead, I made them watch, so that they too hate this universe, as I/Kavin Spacy hate it.

Realizations:

1. I understood, that even though I can do horrible stuff, there is some ¨safety lock¨/¨circuit breaker¨/fuse that doesnt allow me to hurt children. 
2. I understood, that **IF** I was a psychopath [(desire to use people, similar to desire for alcohol)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdPMUX8_8Ms) or a child raper or had some other pathology [(created by insufficient amount of blood in brain)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8) **THEN** I should go to doctor
3. I understood, that maybe it doesn't make much sence to desire the power too much, bc
  - we will anyway live in abundunce (if we will not destroy ourselves)
  - even Genghis Khan, though we had everything, wasnt happy
  - human civilization can survive ONLY IF will become less aggressive [(Neil Degrass Tyson: the desire to breed and colonize the galaxy is self-destructing for the civilization. "It may be that the very kind of civilization that could peacefully colonize a galaxy is not the kind of civilization that would colonize the galaxy at all")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDut-A2GtLA)
