# marijuana

⚠️ **Dont try it until 25 !!! (until Your brain connections are crystalized)** ⚠️

In Ukraine, bc marijuana is not legalized, it is actually sold out with chemicals (<sup>by some people that should be in jail for this, like poroshenko, bc "fish rots from the head"</sup>), that cause damage to the brain. And then, stupid children (like me and my friends) buy it. And then think *"WOW, why I am less smart as I was?"*

*LEARN ON MY MISTAKES!!!*

--------

Now You think: "what will happen if I will try?"

Answer: nothing interesting. 

You will sink into the kind of ["Shephard tone"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone) illusion (this is the sound-illusion, it makes you think that pitch is always increasing)

But the "Shephard tone" for the thoughts. It will make You think:

1. "Wow, this thought I had right now is the most interesting thought/notice I had in my life¨
2. "Oh, no, the tought I just had is NOT the most interesting. NOW is the most interesting thought in my life!!!¨
3. ¨No, no, no.... these two is not the most interesting. NOW is the most interesting¨
4. ....... and so on until infinity

Summary: dont try it, nothing interesting, just makes **"You can be mesmerized by our universe infinitively"** feature of our universe more visible by making you more stupid

⚠️ **It will not make you better/more compassioned person (without reading Eliezer Yudkowsky), as it didnt make Charles Manson a better person** ⚠️

### Prelude: 

Once, my friend have shown me one very bad video, that I couldn't watch it even for a second, but understood what is happening. I will not tell the content of this video. But it involves an infant and a man. At least noone have died.

My first thought was: This should not be forgotten!

And then, in the subconsiousness, unknown to me:
1. Am I capable for these actions?
2. How badly the body I live in should be treated by this universe and inhabitants to desire to do this?
3. 
  - **IF** some person has such desires **THEN** what should he do?
  - Should he go to the doctor?
  - Should he rewire his brain to stop wanting this (maybe it's like an alcohol addiction?) ? (this desire clearly warps the fabric of reality)
  - Should humans follow their natural wiring at all? <sub>(basically, the whole plot of Doctor House, who the whole series cannot decide what is better: to be the psychopath and have everything OR follow natural wiring and be good. Suffering in both cases)</sub> Maybe Sergey Brin 

### Story:

So, one day I tried, then was walking in the woods, then laid and slept and had a dream:

I was Kavin Spacy, that went to
