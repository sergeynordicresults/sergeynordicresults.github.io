Your Japan back then it's now our Russia

Just like japanese people now saying and teaching in schools that Nanjing didn't happen [1](https://qr.ae/pyhdva) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/6fau39/comment/dkkr1ub/?context=3), Russians say that Bucha didn't happen [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XNlSg9CUlc)

  Just like old german woman were saying "No, this is all fake", when they saw a pile of skulls of dead jew people near the cremation furnaces 
  
  1. Why, when I watch cctv news and You show lavrov saying “This war which was launched against us…”, Why [You dont show the laugh?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGizGLceM-I)
  2. Why you dont show what is happening in Ukraine [1](https://t.me/nevzorovtv/8577), [2 (first days of war. there were soldiers in homes? really?)](https://www.facebook.com/hope4ukraine/videos/this-is-never-seen-before-video-pov-from-russian-tank-in-mariupol-shooting-at-re/727612701949066/)
  2. Why You torture [uyghurs](https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-53671502) and tibetian people?
  3. Why You want to start a war with Taiwan and America?
  
  Chinese people say:
  1. "If my country will start a war with Taiwan - ok. **I want to see taiwan people dead**, they are all spies of America, just want to steal our technology"
  1. "Everything will change, when China will take over the world, noone will say ['I want to feed chinese babies to aligators'](https://worldstarhiphop.com/videos/wshhaEUJeT3M8808M0wi/horrible-charleston-white-says-chinese-women-and-babies-deserved-to-be-rped-and-used-as-alligator-bait)" <sub>(I feel Your pain, my friend, Im with You, Im angry with him too, this is just for the fullness of information)</sub>
  1. "Ukranians should just surrender" (yes, while russians torture us. If russians would kill president of Ukraine and would win this war - would You be happy)
  2. "This was is a fault of ukranians, nothing would happen if You didnt want to be closer to Europe"
  1. "We are with ukraine, but You know, this war is a fault of America" <sub>(yes, of course, ["america played with a russian bear"](https://t.me/nevzorovtv/8137)? or maybe its all because of covid - putin and president of usa were not speaking in real life, but through the video calls?)</sub>

# Who were Stalin, Lenin and Mao

.... 

# how to stop wars

Ukraine

So, in 2014, fucking russians said "we give high probability, that if people in Krimea and Donetsk and Lugansk will vote right now for "TO WHICH COUNTRY THEY WANT TO BELONG TO", we think they will choose russia. That's why, without doing this voting, but only because we have such hunch, we will go and fucking liberate this people. Liberate them from their property (stealing buisness from Krimea people), and make the Donetsk and Lugansk a battlefield, so that when ukranians will attack our army, while we are hiding in the buildings, we will say they attack civilians"

Truth be said, I (srghma) give probabilities:
- in 2014: Krimea - 40 russia/60 Ukraine, Donetsk and Lugansk - 30 russia/70 Ukraine
- after a war, after Bucha, after rapes: Krimea - 5 russia/95 Ukraine, Donetsk and Lugansk - 5 russia/95 Ukraine

China tortures Uygur and Tubet people

IRA Catalonia wants to devide from Spain

Blockchain voting app to vote "TO WHICH COUNTRY THEY WANT TO BELONG TO" 

Cons:
1. Ukraine, back in 2014 - there is probability that Ukraine would lose territories. But I it is anyway better than wars
2. China. I know, you are not bad people, you just fear that you will lose territories. OK, yes, I think Tibet and Uygurs will vote for divide, yes, China will become smaller. But does really matter? Will it matter in a world without borders? In a world where we don't work anymore? In a world where all what have left to us is to help each other, until the recipient is fed up with help, just like in Masyana cartoon https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uoU6kE9oSu4

# What have happened in Tiananmen square

"One bad chinese guy wanted to make young chinese students to make a revolution, so that Spain, America, Russia and other countries (7 countries in total) could enter the China, and cause the destruction, as they once have already done. So, yes, some students have died, but it was needed"

.... Waiting approval
