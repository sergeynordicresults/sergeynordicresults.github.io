This is what one of russians have sent me when I asked "why do you attack us"?

He have sent it to me and said "maybe in future we will see the whole truth" (LOL, he still doesn't think that putin-pidaras created a war just to distract people of rUSSIA from problems inside of a country)

# What it is about

1. It contains interviews with putin (pidaras) and yanukovich (old ukr president, pidaras too)
2. The revolution in ukraine in 2014 was created by american government
3. american government heated both sides of revolution: on one side was giving money to ukranian nationalists (right sector, anti-moskow) AND on other side (through some ukranian politics) gave order to ukranian police to beat ordinary people

Film gives a feeling that putin and yanukovich are good guys.

And makes easy to believe that war in Ukraine 2022 was created by America https://twitter.com/srghma/status/1641343143575445506?s=20


# But they don't tell about

1. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-protest_laws_in_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-protest_laws_in_Ukraine) laws of 16th january of 2014, yanukovich wanted to create a new dictatorship in Ukraine (these laws allow: you was on political ralley? ok, one week after (for example) police will come to you and take you to prison)
2. Yes, I agree that America had reasons to remove yANUKOVICH (agent of moskow) from position of president, but pUTIN TOO had reasons to create a revolution - to seize the Krimea while everyone are distracted (because this is what psychopats do, they put quarrel between people and then see if they can get something while parties are weakened). 

So, I wouldn't be shocking for me, if in future we will find out that it was pUTIN who gave weapons and money to ukranian (anti-moskow) "right sector" (even thought they are enermies), to be able to tell later `you see, russian people, they are all nazis, that's why we should "liberate" Ukraine`

So, answer on question *"who have given the policemen an order to attack people? Russia or America? Who have rocked the boat?"* I will answer *"I dont know, probably putin to take Krimea, but revolution have happened, and this is great, I want to live in free european country"*


P.S. Poroshenko is an agent of moskow too, check [Bigus info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZJG_RKktBQ) , he was sending ukranian money to russian soldiers in DNR (donetsk people's republic)


# Preservation of cultures or languages

Preservation of cultures or languages is not the utmost importance for me. I am not going to save the php language from extinction, I would not save the aztec culture with their weekly holidays on "killing people and ripping their hearts out".

I am not fighting to save the ucranian (though, it would be painful) or other language from extinction when there exists aritificial language [Ithkuil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil) which allows to express all possible tenses and moods. (For Ukraine I am fighting because noone wants to live in russian dicratorship)

"The difference between dialects and languages is only in a presence of army"
  

I don't care about Ukrainian culture or Russian culture, the main question is who started the war.

We should not use "culture problem" in the arguments, it's too subjective, some people want to preserve it, others don't. 
  
But the "amount of happiness in 1 square meter / amount of optimizations" can be measured, this is more scientific argument.
  
Ukranian language was dying, country is in charge for it's language. So: at home You can speak any language, default language to use at schools and with clients at shops - language of a country
