Буча 2022:
- отцам и братьям - отрезали носы и уши, связали руки, застрелили в голову из-за спины
- матерей и сестер - изнасиловали, выбросили из машины при побеге и сожгли
- 10ти летнюю девочку - изнасиловали и застрелили
Реакция россии - отослать мобильные крематории на оккупированные территории

-------

BUCHA MASSACRE 2022

This is what russian “liberators” did:

- Fathers - cut off nose, ears, shot from behind
- Mothers - raped, shot, set on fire on retreat
- 10 y.o. - raped, shot

Russia reaction - send mobile crematoriums.
```

```
ЧТО Я ЗНАЮ ТОЧНО:
1. Сестра: Автобус, в котором она с ребенком пыталась перебраться в россию как беженец, по пути был расстрелян 3 раза русскими.
2. Мой друг в Херсоне: все гуманитарные конвои, которые Украина пыталась передать в оккупированный Херсон, были расстреляны или захвачены и съедены русскими. Вместо этого населению они раздают вонючие пропавшие каши и рассказывают как помогают наслению.
3. Тетя: приехал русский мер с телевидением, покрасовался, мы спросили у него "а что делать с разрушенными домами", он сказал "берите кредит в русском банке" и уехал

Не может такого быть, скажешь ты. 

Почему ты так думаешь, если русские даже к СВОИМ военным относятся как к мясу?
- плохое обмундирование, еда, танки настолько ужасные что ваши генералы стреляются
- отправляют ничего не знающих детей на бойню, говорят что это учения и забирают мобильные телефоны чтобы не догадались
- отправляют представителей меньшинств (ведь не так жалко когда умрет узкоглазый, правда?)
- не забирают трупы, как в Чеченской войне
- расстреливают мирных жителей в машинах
- соглашаются что дадут гуманитарный корридор для уезжающих из оккупированных территорий и потом ПРЕДАТЕЛЬСКИ расстреливают мирных людей 
```

# !!!What to do with a war!!!

For people inside of Russia:
- [Solzhenitsyn - "The Gulag Archipelago" - WE SHOULD have killed police with an axe THEN Stalin's machine would stop](https://twitter.com/srghma/status/1498244965780045828) - get an axe
- put recruiting stations on fire (`"Я не пойду убивать братьев": в России парень сжег военкомат, чтобы не ехать на войну в Украину, видео`)
- put politician properties on fire (without damaging people of course)
- ***you know what to do*** with putin (he's a psychopath as Ted Bundy, maybe in future we will be able to cure him, but for now - ***you know what to do***)

For children that were sent on a war without knowing:
- surrender

  1. we treat You as a proper Euro-country
  2. check Arestovich youtube channel, there is an ORDER for us to do this
  3. for my people that think differently: each time russian people see video of our military not behaving well - another 1% is converted to evil

- OR go to any ukrainian house, we are your bothers, we will give you food and shelter

For people from other countries:
- more sanctions - they will not go to streets unless hungry (I wouldnt)
- ITS POSSIBLE THAT NONE UKRAINIAN WILL DIE ANYMORE - we just need more planes to "close the air" (intercept missiles)
- donate ([Government bank](https://bank.gov.ua/en/about/support-the-armed-forces))

# !!!IF you think Russia is right!!! (to ordinary people from pikabu.ru, the "Россия и Украина" tag)

send me an email to srghma@gmail.com, I want to know what You know!

lets have a meeting in google-meets or zoom.

Clash of thoughts create a truth.

<blockquote><details><summary>Zelensky/NATO would attack first? maybe</summary><pre>

Пусть бы НАТО и напало, убедились бы, а так - "вот бы да кабы да Во рту росли грибы"

Украинцы не обосрались когда ваши начали собираться у границы, до последнего верили что не может же ваш пид быть настолько туп

А вы обосрались

Вы напали потому что боялись что через 3 года мы попытаемся вернуть территории?

1. Вам можно усиливать оборону, а нам нельзя?
2. Вам можно нападать, а нам нельзя?
3. Вам можно иметь атомное оружие, а нам нельзя? (я против)

Заметь, я против чтобы Украина нападала чтобы вернуть ДНР и Крым, нападающий всегда в проигрыше.

А хотя не знаю - возможно будет лучше чтобы Украина вернула территории
1. чтобы на телевидении показывали не только российское телевидение
2. чтобы отстроили дороги
3. чтобы прекратились пытки которые вы там проводите (сайт миротворец)
4. чтобы люди проголосовали, название какой страны они хотят чтобы имела их территория. (мне все равно за название, я гражданин мира, и только потом - Украины)

The difference is HOW Ukrainian army will do this.

We will not steal TV - We are not hungry.

We will not rape 10 y.o. girls - there is no Kadyrovites (кадыровцы) amongst us.

We are not under regime of psychopath.

P.S. в "классное" время мы живем, брат может оправдать убийство сестры (ты знаешь о ком я, дядя)

 In my city I don't know ANYONE who doesnt know ukrainian

 I AM:

 2. I DIDNT like ukrainian langauge (language of villigies)
 3. NOW I do like it
    a. because of Bucha

    c. because ukrainian separates кохання and любов
    d. Onuka "украинский для меня, как дорогое праздничное платье, которое я надеваю только на праздники"

 I THINK:

 Ukrainian langauge WAS in danger of extinction (after Bucha - not anymore).

 The country is in charge of preserving a language

 IF you are AGAINST of making ukr lang a main language in schools THEN go away to Russia and live under putin

Stalin continued this, and killed "kulaks" (this is a 20% of people that make 80% of goods in a country) - that's why great hunger started

of course Stalin didnt care - he killed XX% of ukrainians in Holodomor and then moved people from Russia to Ukrainian territory

I don't know WHY the revolution 2014 started.
I heard people were agains Yanukovich. (RIGHT NOW - I am against him too, he is a thief from Donetsk)

next president was Poroshenko (owner of (po) Roshen company) - he have sold Ukraine and his own people to Putin

we have recording (3 videos, the last - https://youtu.be/TEDvUkFMZd4?t=2453):

1. Poroshenko (WHILE BEIGN A PRESIDENT) and Medvedchuk (Putin is the godfather of Medvedchuk's youngest daughter) where sending UKRAINIAN money to RUSSIAN occupants in Donetsk People's Republic (probably they were paid to do this)
2. ... lot of other bad things

BUT with ZELENSKY we lived MUUUUCH better

What he already did:
1. new roads everywhere
2. the Дiя (translated as "Action") application (passport and driving licence in a mobile phone)
3. investments from other countries
4. new government, 51% and more from his team (because all old are completely corrupted)

What Zelensky promised to do:
1. electronic voting for a president (just like in Estonia and better)
2. put Poroshenko in prison

What I wish he would do:
1. WHEN people in liberated Bucha tell "we need this and this" INSTEAD "I will talk with your mayor" BETTER "ok, we will make an application where all people could post proposals to what they need"

## My view on this universe

#### (Why I act as if) God doesn't exist (I mean I don't belive in religion and prayers)

(from "God as illusion" by Charles Dockins)

The atheist is the one that gives 99% probability that god doesnt exist. I am an atheist by this definition.

We cannot prove that god doesnt exist, BUT

1. we can prove that souls don't exist (later).
2. We know how life was created 

We are descendants of "Self-replicating molecules-robots" that "have been created & created now & will be created till the end of universe" RANDOMLY. 

Just like in a "Game of life" automata: you generate random field, give rules, and self-replicating structures appear

3. We don't know why universe was created, but there is an Anthropic principle (we are here because we are here, lol)

Thus, god is an extra variable to a function that works fine without extra variable.

###### Why souls don't exist:

1. I have seen code of "deep learning" and "human-like" neural networks, THUS I think there is no magic soup in the brain.

<details><pre>
    "Human-like" neural network works like this:

    a. each "axon" is just a number from 0.0 to 1.0 (represented as a data, a number, it really exists, not virtual, not only in code, and can be updated, this is a memory)
    b. IF the state of "axon" is more or equal to 0.5 THEN signal goes through axon ELSE doesnt
    c. "axon" have 1 input and 1 output
    d. "neuron" is just a connection, only in code, it collects input from axons, finds average input (sum of inputs divided by length of an input array) and outputs input to other axons

    Process

    You input an image data, like `[0.0, 1.0, 0.5]` (where 0 is white, 1 is black, 0.5 is gray).

    It goes through axons and neurons, and can output for example:
      an array `[0.0, 0.5]` which is the location of eyes for example
      OR just a one number DO_I_SEE_A_DOG (probability from 0.0 to 1.0)

    1. FOR EXAMPLE your neural network outputted DO_I_SEE_A_DOG probability 0.0 on an image with a dog. You know the probability should be 1.0. HOW TO UPDATE WEIGHTS so that is outputs 1.0 number?
    2. You make a copy of your neural network, You update RANDOMLY the weights, +0.1 to one weight, -0.1 to other weight of axon
    3. IF new neural network weights a better THEN replace old "brain" with new "brain" ELSE discard "new" brain, try again to create a "new" brain.

    ```javascript
    let doISeeDog = 0.0
    1_to_1 = 0.0
    brain = {

    }
    input_axon_weights = [0.1, 0.2, 1.0]
    input_axons_average_

    TODO: finish
    ```
   </pre>

</details>


2. (mine) souls don't exist because the teleportation is possible

  By this I mean that there is NOTHING in physics that disallows us to:

    a. (in place A) scan a body of a human for "position" and "type" of each atom
    b. transfer this information to place B
    c. make a copy of human body from atoms from the air
    d. destroy original body (without this the process would be called a "cloning")

<details><pre>
  I believe, the thought process of a new human will start from where the old body stopped thinking, because the memory is just a ratio of Calcium to Potassium (for example, don't remember), (neuron is just a number from 0.0 to 1.0, yes, unlike the previous example it stores state just like axon too, if average signal value is more than neuron state THEN signal is passed to other axons for example)

  NOTE that teleporation is not like a quantum teleporation of electrons
</pre></details>

  so IF you will NOT destroy original body (step `d`) THEN

  a. did the original soul devide to two souls?

  b. or now the original soul operates two bodies from a heaven????

  NO, souls don't exist! Use Occam's razor!

  Soul is an additional variable `c` to a function `f(a, b, c)` that works fine without additional variable `c` (with `a` and `b` variables only) - it means the variable `c` is not used in a body of a function!

4. (Sam Harris proof) souls don't exist because you can devide the connection between two hemispheres (a little, like this is done to treat epilepsy), and now human body will act as if there TWO humans live in ONE body (e.g. one hand is putting closes on, while the other puts them off)

5. (from "Harry Potter and methods of rationality" by Eliezer Yudkowsky) souls don't exist because brain injuries DOES EXIST (A guy was a good man, then his head was injured and he because evil. SOUL?)

#### What will happen after death?

what was before your life - nothing

#### Who we are in this universe

From:
1. ["Cosmology and the arrow of time: Sean Carroll at TEDxCaltech"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMaTyg8wR4Y)
2. and most importantly ["Sean Carroll - The Passage of Time & the Meaning of Life"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BH6XCRZad8)

```
We are a little tornados in a cup on a border of coffee and milk when they are mixed together

1. coffee and milk are fully separated - low entropy, beginning of universe
2. coffee and milk starts to mix - human civilization then black holes are everywhere, but black holes evaporate, hight entropy
3. coffee and milk are fully mixed - all black holes have evaporated, only the plain energy, low entropy again

Soon the process will repeat, all energy combinations will be tried.

Then, in one place, there will be a combination that is same (or almost the same) as the "begging of universe" combination.

New universe, like a bubble amongst other bubbles (other expanding universes in multiverse), have appeared in a glue of "plane energy".
```
