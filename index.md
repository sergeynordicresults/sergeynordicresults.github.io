## My view on this universe

#### (Why I act as if) God doesn't exist

(from "God as illusion" by Charles Dockins) The atheist is the one that gives 99% probability that god doesnt exist. I am an atheist by this definition.

We cannot prove that god doesnt exist, BUT we can prove that souls dont exist.

###### Why souls dont exist:

1. I have seen code of "deep learning" and "human-like" neural networks, THUS I think there is no magic soup in the brain.

<details>
  "Human-like" neural network works like this:
  
    a. each "axon" is just a number from 0.0 to 1.0 (represented as a data, a number, it really exists, not virtual, not only in code, and can be updated, this is a memory) 
    b. IF the state of "axon" is more or equal to 0.5 THEN signal goes through axon ELSE doesnt
    c. "axon" have 1 input and 1 output
    d. "neuron" is just a connection, only in code, it collects input from axons, finds average input (sum of inputs devided by length of an input array) and outputs input to other axons
        
    Process
    
    You input an image data, like `[0.0, 1.0, 0.5]` (where 0 is white, 1 is black, 0.5 is gray).
    
    It goes through axons and neurons, and can output for example:
      an array `[0.0, 0.5]` which is the location of eyes for example
      OR just a one number DO_I_SEE_A_DOG (probability from 0.0 to 1.0)
    
    1. FOR EXAMPLE your neural network outputted DO_I_SEE_A_DOG probablity 0.0 on an image with a dog. You know the probablity should be 1.0. HOW TO UPDATE WEIGHTS so that is outputs 1.0 number?
    2. You make a copy of your neural network, You update RANDOMLY the weights, +0.1 to one weight, -0.1 to other weight of axon
    3. IF new neural network weights a better THEN replace old "brain" with new "brain" ELSE discard "new" brain, try again to create a "new" brain.  

    ```javascript
    let doISeeDog = 0.0
    1_to_1 = 0.0
    brain = {
      
    }
    input_axon_weights = [0.1, 0.2, 1.0]
    input_axons_average_
    
    TODO: finish
    ```

2. (I came up to this myself) souls don't exist because the teleporation is possible

  By this I mean that there is NOTHING in physics that disallows us to: 
  
    a. (in place A) scan a body of a human for "position" and "type" of each atom
    b. transfer this information to place B
    c. make a copy of human body from atoms from the air
    d. destroy original body (without this the process would be called a "cloning")

<details>
  I believe, the thought process of a new human will start from where the old body stopped thinking, because the memory is just a ratio of Calcium to Potassium (for example, dont remember), (neuron is just a number from 0.0 to 1.0, yes, unlike the previous example it stores state just like axon too, if average signal value is more than neuron state THEN signal is passed to other axons for example)
  
  NOTE that teleporation is not like a quantum teleporation of electrons
</details>

  SO: IF you will NOT destroy origianal body THEN did the original soul devided to two? or now the original soul operates two bodies from a heaven???? 
  
  NO, souls dont exist! Use Occam razor! Soul is an additional variable `c` to a function `f(a, b, c)` that works fine without additional variable (with `a` and `b` variables only) - it means the variable `c` is not used in a body of function!
  
4. (Sam Harris proof) souls dont exist because you can devide the connection between two hemispheres a little (like this is done to treat epilepsy), and now human will act as if there two humans live in one body (e.g. one hand is putting closes on, while the other puts off closes)

#### What will happen after death

what was before your life, nothing

#### Who we are in this universe

From https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMaTyg8wR4Y and most importantly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BH6XCRZad8

```
We are a little tornados in a cup on a border of coffee and milk when they are mixed together

1. coffee and milk are fully separated - low entropy, beginning of universe 
2. coffee and milk starts to mix - human civilization then black holes are everywhere, but black holes evaporate, hight entropy 
3. coffee and milk are fully mixed - all black holes have evaporated, only the plain energy, low entropy again

Soon the process will repeat, all energy combinations will be tried and then, in one place, there will be a combination that is same or almost the same as the "begging of universe". New universe, like a bubble amongst other bubbles, have appeared in a glue amongst other expanding universes. The whole thing is called multiverse.
