Watch movie, look at objects, e.g. "shoe", i take a book with "words i have already learned" (this is kind of my anki, but i see all words at the same time), i write in my language "ботинок", 

Then in other list of paper i train this word in chinese, or writing hieroglyphs on the window with a finger. 

So, translate what you see, "he is waking up", "he is brushing teeth", etc.

Anki doesnt help, its a waste of time, bc brain should feel the pain, you should fear you will forget a word, bc it is stored only in the brain.
